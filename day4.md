In your group, fill out the following table:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| ARIA Role | How you describe an element to screen readers. Added to elements when used non-semantically. |
| ARIA | System of describing elements on the page for accessiblity. |
| Application State | State that is available to the entire application. The broadest state. |
| Automated Test | Any test that automatically runs and tests or checks the application. |
| Bound State | State that is bound to something in JSX |
| Child Component | Component included in another component. |
| Component Hierarchy | A parent node at the root, branching out to child nodes in a tree. |
| Component Rerender | A component rerenders itself. The more of them you have, the slower it is, because updating the DOM is expensive. |
| Component | Reusable fragment or encapsulated chunk of JSX. Can have state and side-effects. A custom HTML element. |
| Computed Value | Value that is calculated from another value. |
| Conditional Rendering | Rendering a piece of code based on whether an expression is met. |
| Context Provider | A way to facilitate injection of state into child components. |
| Context | Tool for sharing state between components. Tunnels state from a provider to a consumer. |
| Create React App | Tool for bootstrapping React applications. |
| Dumb Component | Stateless component. |
| Equivalence Partition | A range of values that can be treated interchangeably for a particular behavior. |
| Hook | Injects functionality in the code, allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. |
| JSX | A templating language that combines HTML and JavaScript. |
| Jest | Testing tool that allows you to write assertions and group tests and run them. |
| Jest: `.toEqual()` | Basic value equality test. Asserts values are the same. Typically used for reference values. |
| Jest: `.tobe()` | Stricter comparison, does reference equality. Typically used for primitive values. |
| Jest: `describe` | A way to group tests. Synonym of `context`. |
| Jest: `expect` | Tool for explicit assertions, allows access to matchers. Matchers are helper functions to descriptively check values. |
| Jest: `it` | Alias for test |
| Jest: `test` | Automated code for test case. |
| Keys | When mapping through items, a unique, stable value associated with each item. |
| One-Way Data Flow | When state flows from a parent to a child component. |
| Parent Component | A component that has child components. |
| Pure Function | A function that doesn't produce side-effects, deterministic, no indirect input. |
| React Event Handler | JavaScript function called by a synthetic event that is accessible by JSX. |
| React State | Data that can trigger a rerender of the component. |
| React Testing Library | Useful library to facilitate writing tests. Simulates browser with `screen` and `render`. Provides semantic access to the DOM. |
| React Testing Library: `screen` | Object. Reference anything the user can see the browser. |
| React Testing Library: `render` | Function. Accepts JSX as well as HTML. |
| React | Single-Page Applicaton framework\*. |
| SPA | Single-page application. One HTML page returned from the server, routing changes happen in the browser rather than generating new requests. |
| State Management | Ability to modify the state of the application and how you store and change that state. |
| Testing Library: User Event | Library to help trigger events on a page, like clicking or typing. |
| Testing Library: `find` | Method to fetch an element from the screen, will fail it can't find it. Async. Used when waiting for React to react. |
| Testing Library: `get` | Method to fetch an element from the screen, will fail it can't find it. Sync. |
| Testing Library: `query` | Sync method, will not fail if it doesn't find the element. Used when we want to assert the absence of something. |
| Testing Library: Queries | `find`, `get`, and `query`. Used to get DOM elements from the page/screen. |
| Testing: Mock | Fake implementation of code. Often assertions happen inside the mock. |
| Testing: Spy | Empty fake function. Gives visibility into how the function was called. |
| Testing: `msw` | Mock service worker. Used for faking network calls. |
| Transpilation | Changing code without changing the level of abstraction. Used in babel/webpack, making changes for different types of browsers. |
| Unit Test | Test for the possible unit of code. |
| Webpack | Build/transpilation/tree-shaking/minifiy/transformation tool. |
| `useContext` | React hook used to consume context. |
| `useEffect` | React hook used to manage side-effects. Code that is not directly associated with what's being executed. |
| `useState` | React hook used to manage state for a component. |
